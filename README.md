# Image-upload-with-authentication
This Django project allows users to upload images through a user-friendly web interface. To ensure fair usage, the system restricts image uploads from the same IP address to a maximum of 10 times a day, preventing potential abuse.
The project has been dockerized for seamless deployment and development. The Dockerfile includes the necessary steps to set up the Python environment, install dependencies, and configure the application. The docker-compose.yml file simplifies the process of running the Django server locally.
This solution provides a secure and scalable way to manage image uploads while leveraging the benefits of Docker for ease of deployment and consistency across different environments.
